Deep learning project for AI course in NBI-Handelsakademin. 

Created a CNN model to classify images of faces into different emotions.
Wanted to try to create a login system that uses emotion detection to verify the user to further develop the project.

Added some basic styling with Bootstrap and fun elements. This project is just to demonstrate the use of deep learning and put a fun twist on what this model potentially could be used for.
